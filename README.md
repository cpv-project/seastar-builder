### Install from ubuntu ppa (for users)

Supported version: 18.04 (bionic)

``` text
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:compiv/cpv-project
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install seastar
```

In addition, you have to install gcc-9 because the package is built with it.<br/>
(Why use gcc-9: seastar won't support old compiler for long period, and I don't want to add patches for old compiler)

``` text
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get install g++-9
```

### Compile and execute example program (for users)

``` text
cd examples
g++-9 $(pkg-config --cflags seastar) tcp_echo_server.cpp $(pkg-config --libs seastar) -O3
./a.out
```

### Compile and execute example program in debug mode with sanitizers (for users)

``` text
cd examples
g++-9 $(pkg-config --cflags seastar-debug) tcp_echo_server.cpp $(pkg-config --libs seastar-debug)
./a.out
```

### Build local package (for advance users)

To build this package, gcc-9 is required, see install steps above.

``` text
sh build.sh local
```

### Build source package and publish to ppa (for myself)

``` text
sh build.sh ppa
cd build
dput ppa:username/project seastar_version_source.changes
```

### Performance tips

Because seastar implements custom task scheduler, the performance compare to other framework maybe lower on low end machine, one solution is set higher value of `--task-quota-ms` option, like `--task-quota-ms=20`, this solution has increase throughput by 35% on my vps. Of cause there will be some penalty, see [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/seastar-dev/igjSoMRQupo) for more details.
